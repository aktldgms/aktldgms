## About Me  

I am Abdulkadir Kutludoğmuş, a backend developer from Türkiye, passionate about crafting scalable and efficient backend systems. My programming journey began at the age of 15 when I took my first steps into web development by learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Within a year, I had built and deployed my own static website under the domain "akutludogmus.com." Although the website no longer exists, it was my first hands-on experience with web technologies and taught me the importance of creating functional and user-friendly designs.

As I continued exploring programming, I delved into JavaScript, which laid the foundation for my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. My interest soon expanded to C#, where I experimented with console-based applications, such as a banking system simulator, to deepen my understanding of algorithms. This experience led me to explore game development with Unity, where I gained valuable insights into game mechanics and user interaction.

While I initially pursued game development with a small team and even published a 2D mobile game, **Deep Launch**, on the Play Store, my focus eventually shifted towards backend development. Today, I specialize in Node.js and am dedicated to building robust backend solutions.  

Currently, I’m working on **FitCal**, a fitness app designed to help users manage workout plans efficiently. Alongside this project, I continue to expand my knowledge through advanced programming and system design courses.

## Notable Projects  

- **Deep Launch** *(Published on Play Store)*
  A 2D mobile game developed using Unity and C#. This project was my first venture into the process of app publishing and advertisement integration. Despite its simplicity, it was a valuable learning experience that taught me about collaboration, project deadlines, and launching a product to a real audience.  

- **FitCal** *(In Development)*  
  A fitness application aiming to revolutionize how users create and manage their workout plans. The backend is being developed with Node.js for performance and scalability, while React Native is used to design an intuitive user interface. The app name is a combination of “Fit” (short for fitness) and “Cal” (short for calculator), and its slogan is "Stay Fit!"
