## About Me  

I am Abdulkadir Kutludoğmuş, a backend developer from Türkiye with a strong passion for crafting scalable and efficient backend systems. My programming journey began at the age of 15 when I took my first steps into web development by learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Within a year, I had built and deployed my own static website under the domain "akutludogmus.com." Although the website no longer exists, it was my first hands-on experience with web technologies and taught me the importance of creating functional and user-friendly designs.

As I continued to explore programming, I delved into JavaScript, which laid the foundation for my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. My interest soon expanded to C#, where I experimented with console-based applications, such as a banking system simulator, to deepen my understanding of algorithms. This experience led me to explore game development with Unity, where I gained valuable insights into game mechanics and user interaction.

Initially, I pursued game development with a small team and even published a 2D mobile game, **Deep Launch**, on the Play Store. However, my focus eventually shifted towards backend development, where I specialize in building robust and scalable solutions using Node.js.  

Currently, I’m working on **FitCal**, a fitness app designed to help users manage workout plans efficiently. Alongside this project, I continue to expand my knowledge through advanced programming and system design courses.  

## Technical Skills  
- **Languages:** JavaScript, C#, C++  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Node.js, React Native, Unity  
- **Databases:** MongoDB, SQL  
- **Other Technologies:** Python, Java, Spring, Laravel, WordPress, WPF, Flutter, Android Studio, OpenGL, Game Maker Studio 2  
  *(I briefly explored these technologies, gaining insights that influenced my future preferences.)*

## Notable Projects  

- **Deep Launch** *(Published on Play Store)*  
  A 2D mobile game developed using Unity and C#. This project was my first venture into app publishing and advertisement integration. Despite its simplicity, it provided valuable lessons in collaboration, meeting deadlines, and launching a product to a real audience.  

- **FitCal** *(In Development)*  
  FitCal leverages Node.js for a highly performant backend and React Native for a responsive and interactive user experience. It offers dynamic workout creation and tracking tools. The name "FitCal" combines "Fit" (fitness) and "Cal" (calculator) to reflect its purpose, with the slogan "Stay Fit!" emphasizing its goal.

## Education  

- **42 İstanbul Student** *(Ongoing)*  
  Currently enrolled in 42 İstanbul, a globally recognized programming school that emphasizes peer-to-peer learning and a project-based curriculum. The program fosters critical thinking, teamwork, and advanced technical skills through hands-on challenges and collaborative learning.  
- **BTK Academy Node.js Certification** *(Completed)*  
- **Sadık Turan’s Web Development Course** *(Completed)*
