### 👨‍💻 About Me
At 15, I first dived into coding with **HTML & CSS**, and it’s been quite the ride ever since! 🎢 I've got solid experience in game development with **Unity** and **C#**. My first game on the Play Store, *Deep Launch*, may not be a masterpiece, but it was a good start for a steady learning journey. 🎮 From here, I planned to challenge myself with more complex projects, like *Hell Project*, but life has its twists, and these days, I’m more focused on backend work. 

Here’s a quick run-down of my tech journey:
- **Java**: Got my introduction at school; it was insightful, though Android development didn’t click with me.
- **Flutter**: Dabbled in it but didn’t find my style.
- **JavaScript**: Took on several tutorials and gained practical experience when needed.
- **C++**: Love it ❤️, especially for the technical depth, but haven’t yet built full projects with it.

### 🛠 What I’m Working On
Right now, I’m working on a fitness app using **Node.js** for the web. 💪 I'm also expanding my knowledge of **design patterns** and **SQL**.

### 🌱 Learning Journey
Completed both the **BTK Academy Node.js course** and **Sadık Turan’s Web Development course** on Udemy, and I’m now diving deeper into backend development to build a strong foundation.

### ⚡ Outside the Code
I’m into **powerlifting** 🏋️, and as for cars and motorcycles—let’s say they’re a passion. 🚗🏍️

### 💡 Ask Me About
I’m always happy to chat about **Unity** and **C/C++** projects! 😄
